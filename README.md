# Nim to Kdb bindings
[![](https://github.com/inv2004/kdb_nim/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/inv2004/kdb_nim/actions?query=workflow%3ATests)

**Kdb** is a column-oriented database https://kx.com with built-in Q and K languages. It is quite popular for financial and time-series analytics.

**Nim** is a statically typed compiled programming language with an optional GC https://nim-lang.org. It compiles to very efficient C code, that is why its' speed is often near or equals the vanilla-C implementation. In addition Nim shares a lot of Python-like aspects like syntax and simplicity of usage.

### Reason
The goal of this package is not only to provide bindings between the two languages, but to build statically-checked code and structures on top of Kdb, which, due to it's duck-typed nature leads to a lot of exceptions and errors in Kdb projects.

### Features / TODO:
- [x] Support all Kdb types in low-level binding
- [x] Automatic memory management
- [x] IPC + Sync Replay
- [x] Implicit casting between Nim and Kdb types
- [x] Iterators and mutable iterators
- [x] Separate types for static garanties
- [x] Generic types for K-structures
- [ ] Async-await IO dispatching
- [ ] Historical files access
- [ ] Translate the package into Java/Scala/Kotlin (by request)

### Advantages
The best way to understand the advantages of this package is by going through an example:

#### Init part
Code to run on q-server side to simulate stream data after some-kind of subscription:
```kdb
.u.sub:{[x;y;z] system"t 1000"; .z.ts:{[x;y] -1 .Q.s2 x(`enrich;([] n:10?5))}[.z.w]; (1b; `ok)}
```

Nim-client:
```nim
type
  RequestT = object of RootObj
    n: int

  ReplyT = object of RequestT
    s: Sym

defineTable(RequestT)
defineTable(ReplyT)
```
One of the main ideas of the library is to help to catch all type-related errors during compile time. That's why the first thing we want is to define schema for the tables we use. We generate the schema by *defineTable* declaration from basic language structures which represent a row of our table.

Another point is that Nim has inheritance for structures, and we can use it, so the table *ReplyT* actually has two fields: *n* and *s*.

*defineTable* automatically generates a function which depends on the struct's fields and types during compiletime, not runtime.

```nim
const d = {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three"}.toTable

let client = connect("your-server", 9999)
let rep = client.call[:(bool, Sym)](".u.sub", 123.456, "str", s"sym")
echo rep
```
I would like to point out that we provide a type for call function - and it converts the reply from kdb-side into the provided type if possible. Also, we have implicit converter from nim-types into kdb-structures, so we put most of the types into the function arguments without conversion.

There is also a ``Sym`` type with an ``s`` constructor to easily distinguish sym from string kdb-types, but if you have Sym in the table, functions like add or transform will implicitly convert string into Sym

#### Main part

```nim
while true:
  let (cmd, data) = client.read(RequestT, check = true)
```
The *read* function returns the called function's name and *KTable* of type provided in the first parameter. Also, the function can check that the data received from kdb-side matches the scheme for the table we defined and throw an exception otherwise.

```nim
  let symCol = data.n.mapIt(d.getOrDefault(it))
```
Here we generate a new column for our reply, see how we can access table's fields (``n`` here) and if we made a mistake and typed ``nn`` then we would've had a compilation error: ``Error: undeclared field: 'nn'``.

```nim
  var resp = data.transform(ReplyT, symCol)
```
*transform* function was made to transform tables from one schema to another. By default it makes in-place transformation, so we do not copy the data, but internally enrich low-level kdb data with the new columns or delete some if necessary. We do not need old ``data`` anymore, ``data`` is not available after this transformation. So, to transform ``RequestT`` into ``ReplyT`` we have to add one more column and we provide it in the argument to the function. If ``transform`` does not have arguments except the type, then the column is created with default values for the column's type.

It's important point out that we also do type checking here. If, for example, we want to put floats into the Sym column, we will get a compilation error: ``Error: transform error: expected: Sym, provided: float``

```nim
  resp.add(ReplyT(n: 100, s: "hundred"))
  echo resp
  client.reply(resp)
```
Nim distincts between mutable and immutable data, that is why we defined ``var resp`` as mutable in the previous example because we are modifying it. If we provided a wrong struct or types into the ``add`` function then we would get compilation error, I specifically mentioned this because in kdb the problem can only be found at runtime or even in production.

All types implement the output interface, so you will see a reply after ``echo``
```nim
┌─────┬─────────┐
│ n   │ s       │
├─────┼─────────┤
│ 2   │ two     │
│ 4   │         │
│ 3   │ three   │
.     .         .
│ 100 │ hundred │
└─────┴─────────┘
````
And the last one - just sending reply back to client. Also, please find that it is a reply to *sync request*, which is not possible in standart Kdb-C-binding without additional hacks.
